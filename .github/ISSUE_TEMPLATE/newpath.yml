        This is the repository where Natro Macro stores and fetches patterns and paths confirmed to be safe by the developers. If you want to add a path to the list of safe imports, you are in the right place.
        
        **Due to the complexity of paths, which often involve multiple files, you will need to either contact a staff member to create a PR for you, or fork the repository and create a PR yourself.**
